Microfinance Service Analysis - Technical PowerPoint Content

Slide 1: Title

Project Title: Microfinance Service Analysis

Slide 2: Dataset Overview

Dataset: Micro-credit-Data-file.csv

Tools Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Goal: Predict microfinance client behavior using ML pipeline

Slide 3: Data Preprocessing

Removed redundant/irrelevant columns

Cleaned and formatted data

Used .describe() and .info() for statistical summary

Slide 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation Matrix with sns.heatmap()

Distribution plots for age, loan_amount, income

Frequency check with value_counts()

Outlier detection using boxplot

Slide 5: Feature Engineering

Applied Label Encoding for categorical columns

Created new features from existing data

Slide 6: Model Building

Dataset split using train_test_split()

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression

SVM

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

AdaBoost Classifier

Slide 7: Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

Slide 8: Results & Insights

Best Model: RandomForestClassifier

Accuracy Achieved: ~88%â€“90%

PCA helped reduce noise and improved model stability

Slide 9: Streamlit Deployment

Deployment via Streamlit:

Created an interactive dashboard for model predictions and visualizations

Used Streamlit to showcase resultspredictions, accuracy scores, and insights in a user-friendly interface.
